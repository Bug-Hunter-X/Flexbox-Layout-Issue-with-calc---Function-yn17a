The issue is resolved by ensuring the parent container's width is explicitly defined or by using a different approach that doesn't rely on dynamic calculations within the flexbox item.  A solution involves setting a `min-width` or `width` on the parent container.  If it's absolutely essential to use `calc()`, ensure that all involved values (percentages and fixed values) are correctly determined and that their resolution order works correctly within the context of the flexbox layout.
